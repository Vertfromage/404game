Hello there, so you'd like to contribute to this repository for Hacktoberfest 2021? 

That's great I really enjoy hacktoberfest, I'm going to do some hacking myself this year!

About this project: This project was done for js13kgames 2020 and while I had alot of fun making it, it's far from perfect and I'm far from an expert. Please don't judge me. If you know more than me, which you likely will make sure that your contribution is educational to me and any other beginners by explaining in comments how it works and why it is an improvement. 

- I will put up some issues that will be available, but if you see something begging to be improved by all means make an issue. 

- I will not pull anything that completely changes the spirit of the game. To define "spirit of the game": Robot 404 is a choose your own adventure game.
You're an amnesiac robot with corrupted mission data. Fly around, talk to the town's people to fill in the blanks, and then carry out your mission.

- You should play it at least one before you contribute.
