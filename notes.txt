NOTES:
<!-- Resources used -->
Robot sprite: purchased sprite pack from https://craftpix.net/product/flying-robot-character-sprites/, used robot 1,
assembled in Gimp, shrank to 70px, used posturize to reduce colors thus making end file smaller. Also used piskel for some little changes, 
and tinyPNG to make smaller.
