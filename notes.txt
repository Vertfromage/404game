NOTES:

Accidentally created rocket boots... character will keep going up if you hold the up button or click repeatedly above character. To disable rocket boots would be more complicated than keeping them, so seems like a good idea to keep them.

Accidentally created a situation where if you stand on a single block or on the edge of a platform you'll slip off, also worth keeping. 

Text should be at top, incase it gets cut off on full screen.

Or text could be at the left side if we made the rooms smaller width wise.

Need better touch controls, make function same as key.

Layout: 3/4 screen for platformer, 1/4 screen for adventure text

In sprite Update should be replaced with a version that loops through a sequence of frames, 
that way all the sprites can be in one or two sprite sheets.

Also we should have a basic tween function inside sprite to change
stuff like x,y, direction Ex: idle (move up/down left/right in loop), goTo(move toward player),
run (move away from player), should call tween from update? 

Possible ways to make him shoot on mobile: swipe in the direction you want to shoot (have to check for swipe)
Shoot button, tap on robot (next tap is direction)
